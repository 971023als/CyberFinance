:: Load external functions (might need to adapt or replace this part)
call function.bat

:: Define result file
set TMP1=%SCRIPTNAME%.log
:: Clear the file to start fresh
echo. 2>%TMP1%

:: Add header information to the file
echo CODE [SRV-096] User environment file ownership or permission settings are insufficient >> %TMP1%
echo [Good]: The owner of the user environment file is the user themselves, and permissions are appropriately set >> %TMP1%
echo [Vulnerable]: The owner of the user environment file is not the user themselves, or permissions are inadequately set >> %TMP1%

:: Placeholder for user home directory and owner info extraction function
:: Windows batch does not support arrays and complex parsing as easily as bash
:: This will need significant adaptation or external tooling to replicate functionality

:: Placeholder for the logic to check start files and permissions
:: Windows does not have a direct equivalent to 'ls -l' or 'stat' for detailed permission checks
:: Use 'icacls' for permission viewing and modifying in Windows, but it's quite different from Linux

:: Placeholder for service file checks
:: Checking service files and permissions will require different commands, possibly using PowerShell or external tools

:: Final step to display the result file
type %TMP1%

:: End of script
echo.
echo Script complete.
