:: Placeholder for the checks that would need to be adapted for Windows.
:: For example, checking for unowned files is not straightforward in Windows as it is in Linux.
:: Similarly, checks specific to Linux filesystems or user management need to be replaced with Windows equivalents or omitted.

:: Instead of detailed Linux command examples, here's a simplified structure for conditional logic in batch file:
:: Check for a condition (this is just a placeholder example)
if exist "somefile.txt" (
    echo OK "Specific check result: Good" >> %TMP1%
) else (
    echo WARN "Specific check result: Vulnerable" >> %TMP1%
)

:: Note: The original script's checks are highly Linux-specific and may not have direct equivalents in Windows.
:: This batch file is a basic framework. You would need to identify the Windows equivalents of the checks you want to perform.

:: Display the results
